The utility provides three distinct settings for managing Windows updates: Default (Out of Box) Settings, Security (Recommended) Settings, and Disable ALL Updates (NOT RECOMMENDED!). Each setting offers a different approach to handling updates, catering to various user needs and preferences.

### Default (Out of Box) Settings
- **Description**: This setting retains the default configurations that come with Windows, ensuring no modifications are made.
- **Functionality**: It will remove any custom Windows update settings previously applied.
- **Note**: If update errors persist, reset all updates in the configuration tab to restore all Microsoft Update Services to their default settings, reinstalling them from their servers.

### Security (Recommended) Settings
- **Description**: This is the recommended setting for all computers.
- **Update Schedule**:
    - **Feature Updates**: Delays feature updates by 2 years to avoid potential bugs and instability.
    - **Security Updates**: Installs security updates 4 days after their release to ensure system protection against pressing security flaws.
- **Rationale**:
    - **Feature Updates**: Often introduce new features and bugs; delaying these updates minimizes the risk of system disruptions.
    - **Security Updates**: Essential for patching critical security vulnerabilities. Delaying them by a few days allows for verification of stability and compatibility without leaving the system exposed for extended periods.

### Disable ALL Updates (NOT RECOMMENDED!)
- **Description**: This setting completely disables all Windows updates.
- **Suitability**: May be appropriate for systems used for specific purposes that do not require active internet browsing.
- **Warning**: Disabling updates significantly increases the risk of the system being hacked or infected due to the lack of security patches.
- **Note**: It is strongly advised against using this setting due to the heightened security risks.

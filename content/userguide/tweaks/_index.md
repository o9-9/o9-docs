### Essential Tweaks
Essential Tweaks are modifications and optimizations that are generally safe for most users to implement. These tweaks are designed to enhance system performance, improve privacy, and reduce unnecessary system activities. They are considered low-risk and are recommended for users who want to ensure their system runs smoothly and efficiently without delving too deeply into complex configurations.

### Advanced Tweaks (CAUTION)
Advanced Tweaks are intended for experienced users who have a solid understanding of their system and the potential implications of making deep-level changes. These tweaks involve more significant alterations to the operating system and can provide substantial customization. However, they also carry a higher risk of causing system instability or unintended side effects if not implemented correctly.
